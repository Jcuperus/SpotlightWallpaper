# SpotlightWallpaper
Simple C# program that makes it possible to use the Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers on your desktop.
## Usage

Running the program registers itself to run each time on startup. Wallpapers are stored in the User\Pictures\SpotlightWallpaper directory and update on system startup. To use these wallpapers as your desktop go to the background settings on your system and set your background to a slideshow that uses the SpotlightWallpaper directory.

## Uninstall

Since the program automatically adds itself as a startup program it has to be disabled manually to stop working. To do this go to Task Manager -> Start-up and disable the program (SpotlightWallpaper.exe) in the list.
