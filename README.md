# SpotlightWallpaper
Simple C# program that makes it possible to use the Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers on your desktop. Wallpapers are stored in the User\Pictures\SpotlightWallpaper directory and update on system startup.
## Uninstall
Since the program automatically adds itself as a startup program it has to be disabled manually to stop working. To do this go to Task Manager -> Start-up and disable the program (SpotlightWallpaper.exe) in the list.
